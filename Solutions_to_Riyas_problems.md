1: Global Warming
2: Forgetting Books to carry to school when school was offline
3: forget to hydrate myself regularly
4: Keep Putting things off for tommorow
5: Forget when my classes ae sometimes (ever since it got online) :)


How They Can Be Solved:-

1: Global Warming: An app that tells people not to neglect global warming and warns about its effects.

2: Forgetting to carry books to school: A timetable which is unique and forces you to follow it.

3: Forget to drink fluids :- An App which tells you when to drink and how much water to drink at specific times of the day with reminders.

4: Keep putting things off for tommorow :- Think about its advantages and about its relief when you are done with it rather than putting it off for tommorow

5: Forget when my classes are :- A timetable which is unique and forces you to follow it.


The issue that I face which can be solved using Technology is Forgetting to hydrate/drink fluids Regularly
